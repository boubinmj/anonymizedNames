Wag_Crs0031Sec001,2023,3,FAC_0026,5,5,I found the capital budgeting part of the class most interesting because we learn how investment decisions are made. Everything taught throughout the class was extremely useful and the course was rich with quality material. This course should be required for almost all students at the School. ,I think the Professor is incredibly smart and cares deeply for his students. He makes himself available and is a tremendously kind resource. He is well-versed in what he teaches and his lived experiences make the course even more interesting. I plan on taking another course with him in the fall. ,The Professor  is a fantastic professor. 
Wag_Crs0031Sec001,2023,3,FAC_0026,4,5,I like the Disney Case most since I am a Disney fan and it directly shows the difference in governance between US and Japan.,I like this class since it give me a general idea about corporate finance.,D/A
Wag_Crs0031Sec001,2023,3,FAC_0026,5,5,All of the lessons were very valuable. It was difficult to catch up without a background in finance but the professor was always accessible. ,The Professor is hilarious and a really nice guy. Thank you for a good semester. ,I think regularly scheduled office hours are preferable to office hours by appointment. Aside from that Professor is great. 
Wag_Crs0032Sec001,2023,3,FAC_0026,5,5,This was a great class that covered a very challenging topic (tax credits) across two very important subject areas. I'd appreciate even more of a focus on renewable energy in the coming years!,One of the better classes for the 7-week format!,I really loved the split lecture/discussion format - the only small recommendation I'd make is to try to lower the word count on the slides a bit to make it a bit more digestible for students.
Wag_Crs0006Sec001,2023,3,FAC_0006,5,5,I found the anti-trust week to be the least valuable because it seemed the least related to healthcare. I liked the Medicare Fraud and Abuse section.,I learned the truth about HIPAA!,Engaging lectures
Wag_Crs0006Sec001,2023,3,FAC_0006,4,4,"I liked the privacy law discussions and the topic of antitrust
Nothing stands out to me as ""missing"" from the course topics","I like that each assignment was unrelated to the previous one vs. one large assignment due at the end of the semester
","quick grading on assignments was appreciated

"
Wag_Crs0051Sec001,2023,3,FAC_0029,5,5,All of the topics built on each other and were very valuable. ,I really enjoyed this course and it has helped shape my understanding of how to approach and design programs in addition to evaluating them. ,D/A
Wag_Crs0051Sec001,2023,3,FAC_0029,5,5,Everything was super helpful,This course will definitely be helpful in my career.,Prof is a fantastic instructor and I learned a lot from her lectures. Her course materials are very well put together. It is clear that she continuously updates her materials and delivery (unlike some other professors who operate on autopilot). She's a keeper and will encourage other students to take her class.
Wag_Crs0053Sec001,2023,3,FAC_0030,5,4,All topics are very interesting and very important to understand current health policy issues in the US.,I don't know why the professor start every session on 5:00 pm which is five minutes later than the announced start time.,It would be better if you start the session on time. And I think you should better manage the time.
Wag_Crs0054Sec001,2023,3,FAC_0030,5,5,all good,no,great prof! :)
Wag_Crs0062Sec001,2023,3,FAC_0033,5,5,Every assignment has been valuable and I've learned a lot. We also have excellent class discussions.,I recommend that the curriculum from this course become part of the core curriculum for the School's students.,Professor  has been excellent. I really enjoyed this class discussions and assignments.
Wag_Crs0023Sec001,2023,3,FAC_0021,5,5,All were extraordinarily valuable. I wish we delved more into transportation. ,Fantastic course!!! Super interesting and precient. ,I loved this class. Have a great summer!
Wag_Crs0023Sec001,2023,3,FAC_0021,5,5,I think the most valuable thing we did was the research designs. ,I think it was a really great course and really appreciated it. Thank you for a great semester.,Thank you very much. 
Wag_Crs0023Sec001,2023,3,FAC_0021,4,5,I found topics on Market failures and redistribution policies most valuable. ,No,Thank you!
Wag_Crs0023Sec001,2023,3,FAC_0021,5,5,I liked nearly all the topics we covered. The instructor was always willing to give real life examples which made the class more enjoyable. ,It was an excellent course,She was excellent. 
Wag_Crs0023Sec001,2023,3,FAC_0021,5,5,I found all of the topics which concerned economic policy to be valuable as we specifically looked at real-world examples and every topic felt important.  There could have been less time spent on review topics from microeconomics at the beginning of the course,I really enjoyed the course and thought it was well-organized and well taught!,D/A
Wag_Crs0019Sec002,2023,3,FAC_0016,4,4,What I found most valuable is learning the ability to be able to deal with mass data that I wouldn't be able to do on something like Excel. I didn't really feel anything was least valuable but I would say it was extremely challenging.,I took intro to python class before and had some fundamental knowledge of python but it was still extremely difficult. I think I learned A LOT from the class but I would say that the class covered the topics in a short amount of time. I know this class was also for people without coding skill but I feel like it might be nice to emphasize that having some skills in coding is recommended (I feel like I would not have survived without my past coding class experience).,Thank you!
Wag_Crs0019Sec002,2023,3,FAC_0016,1,2,The fact that the instructor told us to use another Python course online in conjunction with the course we are paying for at the School.,I am extremely disappointed in this course.,The structure for this class is truly horrible. Very little applicable instruction on Python!!! We went STRAIGHT to Pandas and then spent so much time discussing non-coding concepts. I am so disappointed.
Wag_Crs0019Sec002,2023,3,FAC_0016,4,4,More practice time in class would be helpful. One on one session would also be valuable in class,First class can be better utilized. Too much time spent on talking about syllabus and ideas about coding which wasn t super useful. ,The instructor tried to engage students and I appreciate his effort 
Wag_Crs0010Sec001,2023,3,FAC_0008,4,5,I love mini-cases to trigger our ideas and relate to our HR topics.,I love how inclusive the class is. Our voices are valued.,Glad to learn with you!
Wag_Crs0020Sec001,2023,3,FAC_0008,5,4,"Most valuable- learning about the qualitative methods- from beginning to end 
Leat Valuable- Excessive reading (can minimize) ",Great course and professor.  ,D/A
Wag_Crs0020Sec001,2023,3,FAC_0008,5,5,All of the different topics were very valuable and helped piece together the process of a qualitative research study. I wish we had included more about data analysis using a software to see ways that we can review data to discover findings. ,Course was definitely a sprint but I really enjoyed every part of it. ,You are an amazing professor! 
Wag_Crs0024Sec001,2023,3,FAC_0024,5,5,I like the last sessions of the course in which he focussed on personal growth and restoration techniques. ,I feel like some readings were very pretty extensive for a 2-credit class. ,D/A

Wag_Crs0013Sec001,2023,3,FAC_0012,4,5,The specific topics in the later half of the class were valuable. The historical background on the field was a lot to take in at a rapid pace. ,Getting through the required reading is a lot to handle with balancing other classes even before the optional readings. ,D/A

Wag_Crs0028Sec002,2023,3,FAC_0017,2,2,"Most valuable: Zoning in NYC 

Less Valuable: Environment",The structure of the course was not well designed. As students we were able to see how the professor and TA were constructing the course during the semester. THe structure for the final project was not clear until a few weeks before the end of the semester. The topics touch in class are important but were basic. The course is too concentrated in the US and there were few if not international cases.,No
Wag_Crs0028Sec002,2023,3,FAC_0017,3,3,wish we talked more about sustainability and environmental planning ,"the structure was very hard to follow
wish we had more flexibility in the case studies
met with TAs about the content of my case study and still got points taken off even after addressing comments",D/A
Wag_Crs0028Sec002,2023,3,FAC_0017,2,3,I feel like we did not need to have a whole lecture on manufacturing and another on commercial. Perhaps they could be lumped into zoning. That could make zoning a two week topic if necessary but it felt unnecessary especially considering there are many other topics that would be much more relevant such as climate change and issues surrounding that which we could have addressed but didn't. ,It was very difficult to know what to do for this class. The case study documents did not provide clear instructions and the feedback on those case studies was even more unclear and did not provide any way to meaningfully improve for the next one. The course felt poorly organized and taught in a way that did not seem helpful to understanding the methods and practice of planning. Perhaps this course should have been taught by an individual or individuals currently working in the field of planning. It could also be led by the professor but maybe do it more as a colloquium with experts in each topic coming in each week to discuss how those topics play out in real life. ,D/A
Wag_Crs0010Sec001,2023,3,FAC_0008,5,5,the learning pathways grid!,i wish brightspace had been a bit more organized. i also liked the no computers rule. ,The Professor is AWESOME. Loved her teaching style so much. She was encouraging and inspiring.

Wag_Crs0012Sec001,2023,3,FAC_0011,5,5,I found the section on prototyping the most helpful. No section in the class felt unhelpful. ,It's a great class and I hope that more students take it. ,The Professor was outstanding. She is surely to be one of the best professors I've had at the school.
Wag_Crs0012Sec001,2023,3,FAC_0011,5,5,lectures and projects ,such a good class,The Professor is super helpful and inclusive. An excellent lecturer and presenter. 
Wag_Crs0012Sec001,2023,3,FAC_0011,5,5,Clarity around the design thinking process.,The amount of weight given to the team process is daunting because it is very dependent on optimal team dynamics.,It felt like some teams were stronger than others. Some way to ensure balance would be great.
Wag_Crs0026Sec001,2023,3,FAC_0022,4,5,I thought all the topics were valuable and it was organized in such a way that they were able to blend in which each other.,I liked how organized the syllabus and readings were.,D/A

I thoroughly enjoyed the class and talking to him outside of it. He has great perspectives on the political system and its machinations.
Wag_Crs0021Sec001,2023,3,FAC_0019,5,5,I thought that we discussed a good variety of topics that adequately addressed the major issues that are being discussed in modern politics.,I found the readings although slightly time consuming very helpful when it came to understanding the various political perspectives and challenges surrounding a particular issue. The lectures were engaging and the guest speakers were very interesting and knowledgeable.,Professor is very knowledgeable about the inner working of politics and the various political challenges associated with many issues. He was very accessible and helpful in his office hours. He was able to prompt meaningful discussions with the class and his lectures were engaging and interesting.
Wag_Crs0021Sec001,2023,3,FAC_0019,5,5,,,Professor sometimes didn't establish clear guidelines of what he was looking for in essays.
Wag_Crs0021Sec001,2023,3,FAC_0019,5,5,The class on the Three Amigos & climate policy!! I had no idea Lindsey Graham even admitted that the climate crisis exists. ,I wish the lectures provided a more analytical aspect to the reading. Often felt I was just going through summaries of all the assigned readings. ,I suggest somehow enlisting more discussion within the lectures. I often felt I was just hearing summaries of the topics we read about. 
Wag_Crs0025Sec001,2023,3,FAC_0023,5,5,our discussion about privilege vs. power. ,I really enjoyed it and learned alot.,Thank you for being you.

Wag_Crs0027Sec001,2023,3,FAC_0023,5,5,Meditation and learning about self-authenticity was the most valuable.

Wag_Crs0029Sec001,2023,3,FAC_0018,5,5,Every class from the first half where we read cases and learned about the evolution of the legal rationale was super interesting and valuable. Some of the recent classes have felt less focused. ,It's hard to know how I'll feel till I take the final.,I would have liked feedback on my memo.

Wag_Crs0015Sec001,2023,3,FAC_0013,4,5,I suggest looking at the syllabus for Introduction to Public Policy. There was a little repetition between the two courses. Might be a good opportunity to build on those topics as opposed to repeat.,Helpful frameworks to approach political topics.,Thank you!
Wag_Crs0015Sec001,2023,3,FAC_0013,4,4,"Most valuable - learning about education policy and the professors work and research 

Least valuable - unfortunately i didn't find the insight from Mayor De Blasio to be particularly insightful - his approach towards policy contradicted the course and dismissed a lot of important theory ",Overall enjoyed the course! There were dominant voices in the class that I wish hadn't been given as much time to speak - at some points it felt like I was hearing from the same 4 students over and over again. I think the class would have benefitted from some more facilitation and not reinforcing the same voices. I think Professor is great and did a great job with the course and bringing in new and interesting perspectives and ideas. ,D/A
Wag_Crs0015Sec001,2023,3,FAC_0013,5,5,I found the classes on power and protests to be most valuable.

Wag_Crs0003Sec001,2023,3,FAC_0003,4,5, I like topics that I could relate to real world examples,It was a topic I wasn't necessarily interested in but the professor really made the material interesting. ,Great professor. Taught material well and always asked and answered all questions
Wag_Crs0003Sec002,2023,3,FAC_0003,5,5,,Every class packs on many information without a small break in between which can be very very intensive.

Wag_Crs0003Sec002,2023,3,FAC_0003,4,5,I much preferred the 2nd half of the semester.,Excel formulas should be provided way earlier in the course.

Wag_Crs0017Sec001,2023,3,FAC_0014,5,5,I was happy to learn about assumptions and risks because it's important to think about in project management but rarely discussed. I have participated in a lot of different projects and have had a variety of different challenges come up so having a contingency plan is important and necessary. Risks are always present and being aware and having a plan in place for them are really important tools for project management. I think one thing that I would love to have more time on is also the evaluation process or having the professor suggest students take an evaluation class. I took one in the past and it was eye-opening to learn about the process and how it can help make your projects better as well. ,I enjoyed the class and was able to learn a lot about the dynamics of project management. I really liked the movie clip videos that showed project management in a way that wasn't only for work purposes. It made it really easy to retain information. I especially enjoyed the panel.
