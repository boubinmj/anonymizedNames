"{""User"": """,4,5,"I really loved the second half of the semester's topics, since they felt most applicable to the degree.","The Professor has such incredible mastery of the content, and I've really enjoyed learning from her. She is quick on her feet and has a wonderful arsenal of examples at her behest, and I think she has a great sense of humor that she brings to the class. Sometimes, the structure of the class felt like a very slow rollout/reveal of concepts that you have to wait until later to truly grasp or understand. I wonder if there's a way to frame the big-picture takeaways a bit more prominently at the beginning of the course and then at the start of each class to help connect the dots sooner and more thoroughly between concepts. Also, it really feels like the class is set up to reward the minority of full-time students who have time to do all of the extra work and problem-sets, instead of the majority of part-time students who are busy juggling work and school obligations. I wish the course could be set up to be friendlier to the success of the average busy student in terms of workload and tools offered. I know we all need to take responsibility for our learning, but for a core course that everyone must take, it really did feel like the average student struggled a lot more than may be necessary.","As I mentioned in my last comment, the Professor brings so much incredible mastery and knowledge of the subject to the class. She does a great job of balancing the agenda with open-ended room for discussion and questions, which is often hard to do. Again, I do think more reinforcement of the big-picture framing and core concepts would be helpful to the average student in being able to follow along and keep up.
