The duration of any approved leave will be a minimum of one academic semester, or an equivalent four-month period, to a maximum of two academic semesters or the equivalent in months (8 months).

If students are on medical leave, they will need to create a plan for return with your school’s Advising and Leave of Absence contact and the Student Health Center.  All students returning from a leave of absence should contact their academic advisor or school contact to make an academic plan for the upcoming semester. In this meeting, discuss your course plans for the following semester and go over your academic progress toward the completion of your degree. This is typically done in March for students returning from a leave in the Fall semester or in November for students returning from a leave in the Spring semester.

Not sure who in your school to contact? Email your school’s designated contact for students on leave. You can always start with a Student Success Specialist and we will connect you with your academic advisor.

Students should also contact Housing if they plan to live on campus and Financial Aid if they plan to use aid in the upcoming semester. International students must contact the Office of Global Services before taking a leave of absence and to discuss plans you may have to return.
